We as a team have created this KFC assistant using a few Python libraries,openAI, and of course, with the help of API keys. The KFC assistant generally reads out the menu given to us in an Excel sheet where we have created an API link for the menu and infused it in the code. The OpenAI is to provide a friendly user interaction through the appropriate prompt. The project would give clear assistance and generate bills according to the order given by the customer.
